# Software System:

1. Business - **Markets, Products & Services**; **For Global, Market specific Requirements** 
2. Users - **Humans & Machines** 
* Applications, Web or Mobile
* Data
3. Developers - **Hundreds**
* Many Teams, each working on different areas of the Product
* Teams need to control their own development, deployment, and scale
* Without having to co-ordinate their changes with other teams
* Development process needs to be distributed and decoupled just like our software
