# Software System:

1. Business - **Products & Services**
* Local & Global
* Market specific Requirements 
2. Users - **Humans & Machines** 
* Applications
* Data
3. Developers - **Hundreds**
* Many Teams, each working on different areas of the Product
* Teams need to control their own development, deployment, and scale
* Without having to co-ordinate their changes with other teams
* Development process needs to be distributed and decoupled just like our software

0. GitHub - Developers Workflows for CI & CD 

Modeling Domains - **Repositories, Users, Organizations, Payment, Issues, Pull Requests, Fork, Comments, ...**

1. Amazon, Walmart, Target - Users Order Items for Delivery, **schedule** time slots for few categories like produce & perishable, Pickup In-store or Curbside

# Distributed System:

1. Load Balancing
2. Caching
3. CAP Theorem
4. Edge & Cloud Computing

Applications
* Web, Mobile, API, Voice, Desktop & Console 

Data
* Purpose-built Databases
* Data Warehouse
* Data Lake

Availability & minimize the **"blast radius"** of any failures, design techniques:
1. Cell-based architecture
2. Sharding
3. Availability Zones
4. Regions
