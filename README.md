**1. Renting:**

> hyperscalers (Amazon, Google and Microsoft) have moved far outside their initial niche of standard IT infrastructure services. In addition to providing services for developers to reduce time-to-market, they have built specialist services targeted at the major technology trends such as blockchain, 5G, machine learning, artificial intelligence and digital identity. Moreover, they are adding many industry-focused solutions.
