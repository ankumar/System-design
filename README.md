# Software System:

1. Business - **Markets, Products & Services**; **Global, Market specific Requirements** 
2. Users - **Humans & Machines** 
* Applications, Web or Mobile or Voice (Desktop, Console)
* Data
3. Developers - **Hundreds**
* Many Teams, each working on different areas of the Product
* Teams need to control their own development, deployment, and scale
* Without having to co-ordinate their changes with other teams
* Development process needs to be distributed and decoupled just like our software

## 1. Retail
* Users Order Delivery (few categories like produce & perishable **scheduled**) AND/OR Pickup in-store or curbside
## 2. Uber
* Users Order Ride & Food Now or Scheduled, Nearby Drivers get notification, choose to pickup 
## 3. WhatsApp
* Users Text, Photos, Voice or Video 1:1 or Group
## 4. Twitter
* Users create a Profile, Post Text (limited to 140 characters) with "Friends"
## 5. YouTube or Netflix
* 
## 6. Facebook
* Users create a Profile & Post, Text, Link, Photo with "Friends"
* Buy & Sell Items or Services on Marketplace
* Join Groups
## 7. Ticketmaster
* 
## 8. Search
* Finding information 
* Paid Advertisements
## 9. Dropbox

# Distributed System:

1. Load Balancing
2. Caching

3. CAP Theorem


Data
* Purpose-built Databases
* Data Warehouse
* Data Lake

Availability & minimize the **"blast radius"** of any failures, design techniques:
1. Cell-based architecture
2. Sharding
3. Availability Zones
4. Regions
